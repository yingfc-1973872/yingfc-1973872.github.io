        Wikipedia checks its information for authority (what I have been calling vetting ) by having
        many people look at each article, edit it, and check it for accuracy. The idea is that the
        more people you have looking at information, the more likely you are to catch errors or
        omissions and the more authoritative the information will be.
      </p>

        Vetting by the crowd has come a long way and is becoming an important way of checking
        information. mechanical turk is a good example crowd- sourcing . It brings together
        thousands of people who might be just who is needed to solve a problem for you.
